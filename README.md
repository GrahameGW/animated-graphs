# animated-graphs

A series of dancing graphs, created by following the tutorial at https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/mathematical-surfaces/. I have addded some additional patterns beyond the ones in the tutorial, and added some basic toggle input controls.

I wanted to learn more about shaders after struggling with shaders for Corvebawl (https://grahamewatt.com/games/corvebawl), and so went "back to basics." This project allowed be to get a basic understanding of how shaders do their computations, the difference between vertex & fragment shaders, and how to manipulate channels. Shaders are still a source of difficulty for me, but they are at least now no longer entirely incomprehensible.
